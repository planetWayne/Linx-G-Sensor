# Linx-G-Sensor

After trawling the internet for an installation set for the 'G-Sensor' or Orientation sensor in the Linx 10 tablets, I've created this repo as a holding area should I (or others) need a download site.

I found that the set that was included in the 'driver set' from the Linx web site didnt work, had issue with orientation being upside down for each of the horizontal / landscape layouts, even after trying various 'registry' fixes.

The end result being that I think the driver set was a wrong version for the reg tweaks.

I eventually found this version buried in a full set of drivers for various tablets, hence this being a small subset from that set. This version has been used on Windows 10 release 20H2 from a 'fresh' installation and updates that were current at the time this was created (5/4/2021)

To install, unzip and run the batch file. This installs the driver, runs the relavant reg tweak and then reboots.

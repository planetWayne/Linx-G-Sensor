# Linx-G-Sensor

**kxaccel-1.0.13.20-win8-x86** driver + orientation batch file for Linx 10 Tablet

After trawling the internet for an installation set for the 'G-Sensor' or Orientation Sensor in the Linx 10 tablets, I've created this repo as a holding area should I (or others) need a download site.

I found that the set that was included in the 'driver set' from the Linx web site didnt work correctly, had issue with orientation being upside down for each of the horizontal / landscape layouts, even after trying various 'registry' fixes.

The end result being that I think the driver set was a wrong version for the reg tweaks.

I eventually found this version buried in a full set of drivers for various tablets, hence this being just the G-Sensor from that set. This version has been used on Windows 10 release 20H2 from a 'fresh' installation and updates that were current at the time this was created (5/4/2021)

To install, unzip and run the batch file. This installs the driver, runs the relavant reg tweak and then reboots.

Also for reference - Intel Atom Device Drivers also needed.

This web site may help if you need to tweak the orientations or use on another system. There is a LOT of info on how the orientation options work and may help out if you are using this on another system.
